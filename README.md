Code Fellows
============

RubyLibrary:<p>
(1) Use object-oriented Ruby to model a public library (w/ three classes: Library, Shelf, & Book). The library should be aware of a number of shelves. Each shelf should know what books it contains. Make the book object have "enshelf" and "unshelf" methods that control what shelf the book is sitting on. The library should have a method to report all books it contains. Note: this should *not* be a Rails app - just a single file with three classes (plus commands at the bottom showing it works) is all that is needed. 

To-Do List:<p>
(2) Make a simple html page to manage Todos. It should have an input field. When the user enters text in the input field, add that input to the top of the Todo list. When an existing item is clicked, it should disappear from the page.


Demo_app:<p>
(3) Generate a Rails app that allows a user to create, edit, update, and destroy (delete) users. Users should have first name, last name, and email address fields. Deploy this app to Heroku (a free *.herokuapp.com URL) so we can test it out live. If you have time, add extra features to this app (be creative) and tell us what you did so we donâ€™t miss it.
